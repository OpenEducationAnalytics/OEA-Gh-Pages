**Define the Use Case Problem to solve through documenting decisions in the OEA Use Case Template​: [Download OEA Use Case Template​](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FOpenEduAnalytics%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2FOpen_Education_Analytics_Use_Case_Template_v3.docx&wdOrigin=BROWSELINK)**

OEA recommends starting data projects by defining the problem to be solved for learners and learning up front.


Collaborating with key stakeholders in defining the problem (such as learners, educators, school leaders and the data team) can prevent many problems such as: 
- Asking the wrong questions 

- Using the wrong type of data or too much data for the use case 

- Making incorrect assumptions 

- Alienating the people who will use the data solution
