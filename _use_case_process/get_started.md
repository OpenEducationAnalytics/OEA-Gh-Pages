Open Education Analytics is a process to get started on the data modernization and AI journey, developed by education systems in collaboration with Microsoft Education. The OEA Use Case Template provides a guide for designing and documenting decisions to ensure data and AI are used ethically and responsibly. OEA technical resources make getting started on data modernization much faster, with a standard reference architecture that can be quickly deployed. Finally, open source modules and packages in OEA make it easier to explore common education datasets and to build models for education scenarios.
